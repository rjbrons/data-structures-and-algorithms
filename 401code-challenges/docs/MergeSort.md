# Merge Sort

## Description
Complete a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort, based on the pseudo code provided


## Approach & Efficiency
Using the algorithm provided, I implemented a recursive merge sort.
The efficiency of merge sort is O(n * log N) due to the fact that we halve the array each time while breaking it down and then reassemble it linearly.
