# Quick Sort

## Description
Complete a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort, based on the pseudo code provided


## Approach & Efficiency
Using the algorithm provided, I implemented a recursive quick sort.

Quick sort is an O(n * lg n) operation similarly to merge sort as it breaks the array down into halves and works on each half.  
It does use less space than merge since it does not create new arrays, merely manipulates the input array.
